AI refers to the autonomous intelligent behavior of software or machines that have a 
human-like ability to make decisions and to improve over time by learning from 
experience. Currently, popular approaches include statistical methods, computational 
intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI.  There are a large number of tools used in AI,
 including versions of search and mathematical optimization, logic, methods based on
 probability and economics, and many others. In business intelligence, we are evolving
 from static reports on what has already happened to proactive analytics with a live 
dashboard assisting businesses with more accurate reporting. They indeed enable you
 to see what is happening at every moment and send alerts when something is off-
trend. When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they 
usually think of is robots. That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories
 about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be 
further from the truth.  Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human 
intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks,
 from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence
 include mimicking human cognitive activity. Researchers and developers in the field are 
making surprisingly rapid strides in mimicking activities such as learning, reasoning, 
and perception, to the extent that these can be concretely defined. Some believe that 
innovators may soon be able to develop systems that exceed the capacity of humans to 
learn or reason out any subject. But others remain skeptical because all cognitive activity 
is laced with value judgements that are subject to human experience.
